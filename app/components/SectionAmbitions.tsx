      <p>
        Thanks for checking out my site. I'm a software engineer based in
        Seattle. If you are looking to hire an experienced front-end developer,
        please check out my resume and feel free to contact me any time. Outside
        work, I enjoy hiking, soccer, cooking, reading, and spending time with
        family.
